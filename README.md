Your Rhythms to Health

Rhythmical therapy application for children with dyslexia and aphasia.

AlgoRhythm: a rhythm-training app for children with dyslexia and aphasia, which helps treat these disorders by wiring neurones associated with music playing and perception pathways.

AlgoRhythm is an app designed for children with dyslexia and aphasia, which works on rhythmic training - a procedure that many studies have shown is useful in treating these two disorders. Music therapy has become a popular research area lately, and rhythmical training in particular has shown surprising benefits especially with children. In this app an AI model will generate different levels of rhythms that the user must repeat to progress to higher levels. You start off with getting easy rhythms, and with every successfull replication by pressing a designated button on the screen, you get increasingly difficult patterns. Our initial model will be simplified to having three easy, three medium and three hard levels, however, more will be added as the app is developed futher
